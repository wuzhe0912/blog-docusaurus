## Overview

In HTML, we have three main ways to load JavaScript files:

1. `<script>`
2. `<script async>`
3. `<script defer>`

These three methods have different behaviors when loading and executing scripts.

## Detailed Comparison

### `<script>`

- **Behavior**: When the browser encounters this tag, it stops parsing HTML, downloads and executes the script, then continues parsing HTML.
- **When to use**: Suitable for scripts that are critical to page rendering.
- **Advantages**: Ensures scripts are executed in order.
- **Disadvantages**: May delay page rendering.

```html
<script src="important.js"></script>
```

### `<script async>`

- **Behavior**ï¼šThe browser downloads the script in the background while continuing to parse HTML. The script is executed immediately after download, which may interrupt HTML parsing.
- **When to use**ï¼šSuitable for independent scripts, such as analytics or advertising scripts.
- **Advantages**ï¼šDoes not block HTML parsing, can improve page load speed.
- **Disadvantages**ï¼šExecution order is not guaranteed, may execute before the DOM is fully loaded.

```html
<script async src="analytics.js"></script>
```

### `<script defer>`

- **Behavior**ï¼šThe browser downloads the script in the background but waits until HTML parsing is complete before executing. Multiple deferred scripts are executed in the order they appear in the HTML.
- **When to use**ï¼šSuitable for scripts that need the complete DOM structure but are not immediately necessary.
- **Advantages**ï¼šDoes not block HTML parsing, guarantees execution order, suitable for DOM-dependent scripts.
- **Disadvantages**ï¼šIf the script is important, it may delay the page's interactive time.

```html
<script defer src="ui-enhancements.js"></script>
```

## Case Study

Imagine you're preparing for a dateï¼š

1. **`<script>`**ï¼š
   It's like stopping all your preparations to make a phone call to your partner to confirm date details. While it ensures communication, it might delay your preparation time.

2. **`<script async>`**ï¼š
   This is equivalent to using a Bluetooth headset to talk to your partner while preparing. Efficiency is improved, but you might wear the wrong clothes because you're too focused on the call.

3. **`<script defer>`**ï¼š
   This is like sending a message to your partner, telling them you'll call back after you're done preparing. This way, you can focus on preparing and communicate properly when everything is ready.
