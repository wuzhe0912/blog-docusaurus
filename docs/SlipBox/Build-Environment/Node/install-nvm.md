## Error Fixed(Mac)

Previously, when I adjusted the hardware equipment, lead to environment an error. Record at that time situation and solution.

When open terminal, can seen the error like this :

```bash
nvm is not compatible with the npm config ‚Äúprefix‚Äù option: currently set to ‚Äú/Users/xxx/.nvm/versions/node/v8.12.0"
Run `npm config delete prefix` or `nvm use --delete-prefix v8.12.0 --silent` to unset it.
```

From the meanings of error text, should be npm is not match with nvm control version.

According to terminal provide support message to enter command, and check node version, seem like normal.

In fact, if open terminal new tab, still seen same error, so I use the following solution :

```bash
npm config delete prefix
npm config set prefix $NVM_DIR/versions/node/v8.12.0
```

This command mean is delete `npm` setting prefix, re setting and use `nvm` control version.

Now, open new tab can seen is normal.
