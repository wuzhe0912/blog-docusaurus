## Hello Node.js

Create a folder name is Demo, and include html, js file, and use `VSCode` open.

```bash
mkdir demo

cd demo

touch index.html app.js

code .
```

Switch to `app.js` writing something like this :

```js
const app = 'Hello Node.js';

console.log(app);
```

Open terminal and run command like this :

```bash
node app.js
```

We can see terminal print `Hello Node.js`, this is most basic use node.js run js file.

Now, try to run loop.

```js
for (let i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
  console.log(i);
}
```

Run `node app.js`ï¼Œnow except print `Hello Node.js`ï¼Œand seen number `0~4` is printed in order.

## filename and dirname

node.js api provide `__filename` to check current file position. And `__dirname` can check folder position.

Notice, these can't run in browser, terminal only.

```js
console.log(__filename);
console.log(__dirname);
```

```bash
node app.js
```

## Self Made Modules

Sometimes, I want to create module for project use, but if there are need more than one module, how should I deal with that?

Build `player` folder and three file. Use index.js control folder index, and other js file will import to index.js.

```bash
mkdir player

cd player

touch index.js player1.js player2.js
```

```js
// player1.js
function barbarian(name) {
  console.log(`Hello Barbarin : ${name}`);
}
exports.barbarian = barbarian;

// player2.js
function witchDoctor(name) {
  console.log(`Hello Witch Doctor : ${name}`);
}
exports.witchDoctor = witchDoctor;

// index.js
const player1 = require('./player1');
const player2 = require('./player2');

exports.barbarian = player1.barbarian;
exports.witchDoctor = player2.witchDoctor;
```

Switch to `app.js`, import `player` folder, now can use all function in the `player` folder.

```js
// app.js
const player = require('./player');

player.barbarian('Mario');
player.witchDoctor('Paul');
```

## Common Modules built in Node.js

### path

Use `path` to check current file location, and use `join()` to stuff in the parameters into the path.

```js
const path = require('path');

let target = path.join(__dirname, 'test.js');
console.log(target);
```

- [Reference](https://nodejs.org/docs/latest/api/path.html#pathjoinpaths)

Other api use method can also be found in the official documentation.

### url

Use `url` api can parse url path and return url object, include protocol, host and path such as.

```js
const url = require('url');

const blogURL = 'https://pitt-docusaurus.netlify.app/docs/modules';

const parsedURL = url.parse(blogURL);

console.log(parsedURL);
console.log(parsedURL.host);
```

### fs (file system)

Use `fs` can record what happens when past in the system. Convenient for checking and currecting errors.

Here, I try to build a markdown file and write something.

```js
const fs = require('fs');

fs.writeFile('player.md', 'Test write Markdown file.', (e) => {
  if (e) throw e;

  console.log('File has been written.');
});
```

read it.

```js
fs.readFile('./player.md', 'utf-8', (e, data) => {
  if (e) throw e;
  console.log(data);
});
```
