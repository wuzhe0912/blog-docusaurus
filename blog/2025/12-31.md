A year-end summary for 2025. Continuing the tradition, reflecting on the year by asking myself questions once again.

<!--truncate-->

## 1. What did you do this year that you've never done before?

Took on a project coaching role at HexSchool for the first time. Beyond being my first step into part-time work, it was also an attempt at something very different from pure development -- more of a PM-like role.

## 2. Did you keep your New Year's resolutions?

I didn't set any specific plans at the start of 2025, but looking back, it turned out to be a year of real growth.

## 3. Did anyone close to you give birth?

Yes.

## 4. Did anyone close to you die?

Yes. My uncle's wife passed away.

## 5. What cities/states/countries did you visit this year?

Traveled to Osaka and Kyoto, Japan in the fall.

## 6. What do you wish you had next year that you didn't have this year?

I hope to explore entirely new fields. Especially in this AI era, I want to broaden my range as much as possible.

## 7. What date will remain etched in your memory forever? Why?

I explored a lot of new things this year, but nothing burned a specific date into my memory.

## 8. What was your biggest achievement this year?

- Successfully took on a part-time PM coaching role -- my first cross-domain work outside of pure development.
- Traveled to Kyoto, Japan.
- Completely transformed my development workflow: embraced CLI-first, with the code editor as a secondary tool.
- Bought my wife a new iPhone.
- As an ordinary person, I appeared as an extra in a commercial. Might not sound like much, but it was a genuinely new experience.

## 9. What was your biggest failure?

I'd planned to take the JLPT N5 at the end of the year, but the timing collided with my company's layoffs. I was in the thick of interviews and offer negotiations, with no energy or headspace to prepare. I had to give up. Lost the exam fee, and missed out on the challenge.

## 10. What difficulties did you face?

Got hit by a mass layoff at year-end, and had to scramble to find a new job before the 2026 Lunar New Year.

## 11. Did you get sick or injured?

Getting sick is unavoidable when you have a kid. My son catches a cold, and the whole family goes down with him.

## 12. What was the best thing you bought this year?

The new iPhone I gave to my wife.

## 13. Whose behavior deserves celebrating?

A friend who joined the parenting army. A true hero.

## 14. Whose behavior shocked you?

When a friend in the media industry invited me to appear in a commercial -- even just as a random extra. That was unexpected.

## 15. Where did most of your money go?

My son. That little money-eating machine.

## 16. What were you really, really, really excited about?

Getting ready to leave for the Kyoto trip.

## 17. What song will always remind you of this year?

No particular song. I just listened to whatever came on.

## 18. Compared to this time last year, are you happier or sadder? Thinner or fatter? Richer or poorer?

Happier, I think. Didn't get fatter, but didn't lose weight either. Assets stayed about the same -- no major progress.

## 19. What do you wish you'd done more of?

I should seriously consider signing up for a weight training program. At the very least, I need to bring my weight down and avoid chronic diseases.

## 20. What do you wish you'd done less of?

Nothing in particular.

## 21. How did you spend the holidays?

Mostly going out with my wife and son, or traveling.

## 22. Did you fall in love this year?

I'm married, so...

## 23. Is there anyone you disliked this year that you didn't last year?

No.

## 24. What was your favorite show?

Nothing in particular.

## 25. What was the best book you read this year?

*The Normans*.

## 26. What was your biggest musical discovery this year?

AI keeps getting stronger, and even AI-generated music is surprisingly impressive now.

## 27. What was your favorite movie?

Didn't watch many. Probably *Mercy*.

## 28. What was your favorite meal?

Yakiniku.

## 29. What did you want and get?

After seven years, I finally got myself a new iPhone.

## 30. What did you want and not get?

Didn't get to take the JLPT N5.

## 31. What did you do on your birthday?

Had dinner with my wife.

## 32. What one thing would have made your year more satisfying?

If I'd actually managed to lose weight, I'd feel a lot better physically.

## 33. What was your personal fashion style this year?

Comfort and simplicity. Shorts are the way.

## 34. What kept you sane?

Coffee.

## 35. Which celebrity/public figure do you admire most?

No one in particular.

## 36. What political issue stirred you up the most?

The rapid deterioration of cross-strait geopolitical tensions.

## 37. Who did you miss the most?

My wife and son.

## 38. Who was the best new person you met this year?

Met a group of great people this year. Though, thanks to the layoffs, we all became former colleagues.

## 39. What was the most valuable life lesson you learned this year?

Be careful and deliberate about how you live your life.

## 40. What quote sums up your year?

"No plans at the start of the year, laid off at the end, but I tried a bit of everything in between."
