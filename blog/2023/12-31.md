A year-end summary for 2023 -- reflecting on my growth by asking myself questions.

<!--truncate-->

## 1. What did you do this year that you've never done before?

- Worked fully remote.
- Had a child. From being there for the labor to the birth itself, and then postpartum childcare -- incredibly tough.

## 2. Did you keep your New Year's resolutions?

- [x] Although I didn't get to do backend work at my job, I did participate as a backend developer in a side project with teammates, and had actual output. So I'd say I met that goal.
- [ ] Building a personal brand -- didn't happen. Partly because I'm lazy, and partly because the second half of the year was consumed by childcare.

## 3. Did anyone close to you give birth?

- Yes, we did -- our family had a baby.

## 4. Did anyone close to you die?

- No.

## 5. What cities/states/countries did you visit this year?

At the end of the year, my wife and I traveled to Tokyo, Japan.

## 6. What do you wish you had next year that you didn't have this year?

- A personal brand. No matter what, I have to start building one this year.
- Weight loss. Even though childcare eats up a lot of time, for my own health, this can't be avoided.

## 7. What date will remain etched in your memory forever? Why?

- June 27th. The grueling experience of being there for my wife's labor, and the birth of my son.

## 8. What was your biggest achievement this year?

- Presenting our team's side project on stage.
- Becoming a father (even though the hardship far exceeded my imagination).

## 9. What was your biggest failure?

- I was hoping to have a stable remote job, but the company started layoffs within a year. I found a new job quickly, but it wasn't remote, so I had to face moving back to Taipei.

## 10. What difficulties did you face?

- Lost my remote job and had to go back to working in an office.
- The mental energy and focus drained by childcare, the time it takes up, and the inconvenience of going anywhere with a baby.

## 11. Did you get sick or injured?

- Our whole family of three got COVID, one after another.

## 12. What was the best thing you bought this year?

- Souvenirs I gave to friends.

## 13. Whose behavior deserves celebrating?

- My wife's courage -- she managed to get through the delivery despite immense pain.

## 14. Whose behavior shocked you?

- When I found out I was being laid off.

## 15. Where did most of your money go?

## 16. What were you really, really, really excited about?

## 17. What song will always remind you of this year?

- I didn't particularly follow any songs.

## 18. Compared to this time last year, are you happier or sadder? Thinner or fatter? Richer or poorer?

- A bit more down, to be honest. Raising a child turned out to be far harder than my wife and I expected.
- No change in weight, but I still need to figure out how to lose some.
- Despite spending way more this year, surprisingly, when I tallied things up at year-end, my total assets had still grown by a decent percentage.

## 19. What do you wish you'd done more of?

- Steadily improving my professional skills to stay competitive in the market.

## 32. What one thing would have made your year more satisfying?

- If there had been more remote work opportunities to choose from, that would have been great.

## 40. What quote sums up your year?

- I kept telling myself to "be brave and step out of my comfort zone," but every step was painful. I guess that's just life.
